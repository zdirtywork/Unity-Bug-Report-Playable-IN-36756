## How to reproduce

1. Open the "SampleScene".
2. Enter play mode, and you will see the character walking in the Game view.
3. Click the "SetTime(0) twice" button in the Game view.
   
Expected result: The characterâ€™s position does not jump forward or back.
Actual result: The character's position jumps forward or back.
